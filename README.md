# Hotel-Management-System
"I developed a Java-based hotel management system with MySQL for robust data handling. It streamlines tasks like reservations, check-in/check-out, room assignments, and billing. The user-friendly interface, built using Java Swing and AWT, demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, UI design, and database management."
